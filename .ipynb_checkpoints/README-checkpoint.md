# Borrower-risk-assessment-model
 
## Problem Statement
The client has collected data on initial borrowers and seeks a data consultant's expertise to explore this data and identify key attributes that can predict whether a borrower is risky before offering a loan. The ultimate goal is to develop a reliable risk assessment model that can be integrated into their loan approval process, ensuring more informed lending decisions and reducing the risk of loan defaults.

## Needs solution for:
Improved Loan Approval Accuracy:
By identifying key risk factors, the model will help the client approve loans to creditworthy borrowers, thereby reducing the default rate and enhancing the overall portfolio quality.

Enhanced Decision-Making:
With a data-driven approach, the client can make more informed and consistent lending decisions, moving away from subjective judgment to objective risk assessment.

Cost Efficiency:
By predicting risky borrowers, the client can minimize the financial losses associated with loan defaults. This will also reduce the costs related to debt collection and legal proceedings.
Customer Segmentation:

The analysis can provide insights into different borrower segments, allowing the client to tailor their products and services to meet the needs of various customer groups more effectively.
Competitive Advantage:

Implementing an advanced risk assessment model can position the client ahead of competitors by leveraging cutting-edge data analytics to optimize their lending process.
Regulatory Compliance:

Ensuring that lending decisions are backed by solid data analysis can help the client comply with regulatory requirements, thus avoiding potential fines and sanctions.
Risk Mitigation:

By understanding the attributes that contribute to borrower risk, the client can develop strategies to mitigate these risks, such as offering financial education to borrowers or adjusting loan terms based on risk profiles.
Increased Profitability:

Reducing the default rate and improving the accuracy of loan approvals can lead to higher profitability for the client, as more loans are repaid on time and in full.
By leveraging data analysis to identify risky borrowers, the client can significantly enhance their lending process, leading to more sustainable business growth and better financial health.

## Project Steps

### Step 1: Data Understanding and Cleaning
1. **Load the Data**: Read the dataset into a data frame.
2. **Inspect the Data**: Get an overview of the dataset, including its shape, data types, and summary statistics.
3. **Handle Missing Values**: Identify and handle missing values by filling, dropping, or imputing them.
4. **Encode Categorical Variables**: Convert categorical variables into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

### Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. **Visualize Data Distributions**: Plot distributions of numerical features to understand their spread and identify any anomalies.
2. **Analyze Categorical Variables**: Plot the frequency of categorical variables to understand their distribution.
3. **Identify Correlations**: Use a heatmap to visualize correlations between features.
4. **Analyze Relationships with the Target Variable**: Examine how different features relate to the target variable (`imdb success`).

### Step 3: Model Building
1. **Split the Data**: Divide the data into training and testing sets.
2. **Train Multiple Models**: Train various models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, etc.
3. **Evaluate Models**: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC to evaluate model performance.
4. **Select the Best Model**: Choose the model with the best performance based on the evaluation metrics.

### Step 4: Documentation and Reporting
1. **Document Findings**: Summarize the insights from the EDA and model evaluation.
2. **Answer Specific Questions**: Address the 17 specific questions provided in the Google Form.
3. **Provide Recommendations**: Suggest actionable insights and recommendations based on the modelâ€™s predictions.
4. **Prepare a Report**: Create a comprehensive report detailing the methodology, findings, and recommendations.
5. **Presentation**: Prepare a presentation to communicate the findings and recommendations to stakeholders.
